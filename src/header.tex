I believe that learning is a lifelong process. \textbf{Software engineering} today is an ever-changing industry.
I like to keep track of its changes, and I deliberately \textbf{strive to be better} at what I do.
In my spare time, I like to \textbf{expand my knowledge} besides the technologies we use at work and write \textbf{blog posts} about them.
